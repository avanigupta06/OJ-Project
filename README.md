## 🐳 Docker Integration

Docker ensures secure and isolated code execution. Each code run or submission spins up a Docker container to:
- Avoid malicious code execution risks
- Provide language-specific environments
- Improve system scalability

> ✅ Docker must be installed and running for local development.

---

## ☁️ Deployment (AWS EC2 + ECR)

The system is containerized and deployed to the cloud via:
- **Amazon EC2**: Hosts the main Django app
- **Amazon ECR**: Stores and pulls Docker images used in code execution

### 🛠️ Deployment Summary
- Docker image of the project is pushed to **Amazon ECR**
- EC2 instance pulls and runs the image
